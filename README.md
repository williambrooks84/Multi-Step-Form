## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Tailwindcss
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) - JS library


### What I learned

This project helped me learn how to use Nuxt and how to compile it to a static page during my internship. Before my internship I only had experience with the React framework so this helped me learn something new. I already learned how to use Tailwindcss way before but this helped me imprive my skills in Tailwind, like the use of themes and components in the style.css file.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my internship leader for helping me upload this project to Github. If it wasn't for him it wouldn't have been as easily possible.
